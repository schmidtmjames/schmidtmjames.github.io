Alvin Fielder currently resides in Jackson, MS, but spoke to me while he was in Austin performing at the February 2016 No Idea festival.

Alvin moved to Houston in the mid-1950s to pursue a pharmacy degree at Texas Southern in the 3rd Ward. Although in his late teens, he quickly integrated himself into Houston jazz and rhythm and blues scenes. He became the drummer for Puma Davis, who led the band at the Eldorado, one of the elegant, postwar middle class black ballrooms in the Bayou city. 

Amongst many things, Mr. Fielder discussed the richness of the Houston R&B and bebop scene in Houston during the 1950s. Bebop was being played everywhere, he remembered, and the city was full of talent. Some musicians, like Arnett Cobb, already had a significant career and had returned home. Others went on to record for important labels and became (or were already a) part of the national--and international--story of jazz history: Don Wilkerson, Henry Boozier, Joe Sample, G.T. Hogan, Jimmy Harrison, Joe Curtis, and Richie Goldberg. Fielder noted that there were also significant local players who never came to the awareness of the public outside of Houston. J.D. Norris, a tenor saxophone player who played like early Sonny Rollins; Alexander Sample (Joe's brother), piano; and Perry Deal, a pianist who reminded Fielder of Muhal Richard Abrams and who he declared "was the most creative piano player to come out of Houston."
